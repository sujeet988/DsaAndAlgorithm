Transpose of a matrix:
Converting rows of a matrix into columns and columns of a matrix into row is 
called transpose of a matrix.

symmetric matrix: 
A symmetric matrix is that matrix whose tranpose ie equall to the matrix itself. means after changes 
to rows to columns  or colums to rows, it became original matrix.

A symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose. In other words, if we have a matrix A and its transpose is 
denoted by A^T, then A is symmetric if A = A^T.
