Transpose of a matrix:
Converting rows of a matrix into columns and columns of a matrix into row is 
called transpose of a matrix.

symmetric matrix: 
A symmetric matrix is that matrix whose tranpose ie equall to the matrix itself. means after changes 
to rows to columns  or colums to rows, it became original matrix.

A symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose. In other words, if we have a matrix A and its transpose is 
denoted by A^T, then A is symmetric if A = A^T.

---Symmetric pair
Two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are said to be symmetric 
if c is equal to b and a is equal to d. 
For example, (10, 20) and (20, 10) are symmetric. 
Given an array of pairs find all symmetric pairs in it.
Example 1:
Input: (1,2),(2,1),(3,4),(4,5),(5,4)
Output: (2,1) (5,4)
Explanation: Since (1,2) and (2,1) are symmetric pairs and (4,5) and (5,4) are symmetric pairs.

Example 2:
Input: (1,5),(2,3),(4,2),(5,1),(2,4)
Output: (2,4) (5,1)
Explanation: Since (1,5) and (2,4) are symmetric pairs and (5,1) and (4,2) are symmetric pairs.
