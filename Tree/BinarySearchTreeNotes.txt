A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree data structure where each node has a key 
(or value) and satisfies the following properties:

The key of every node in the left subtree is less than the key of the node itself.
The key of every node in the right subtree is greater than the key of the node itself.
The left and right subtrees of every node are also binary search trees.

This ordering property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It enables us to quickly find, insert, 
or remove elements from the tree based on their keys.
