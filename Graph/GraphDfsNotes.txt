BFS : Depth First Search
---(Pre,post,Inorder)  traversal of tree is also called DFS.
-- it is implented using stack or recursion
--DFS
Depth First Traversal is a traversal technique/algorithm, used to traverse through all the nodes in the given graph.

It starts traversal through any one of its neighbour nodes and explores the farthest possible node in each path/branch 
and then starts Back-tracking.

Backtracking happens when the DFS algorithm reaches a particular node that has no neighbours to visit further, 
once it reaches that node with no neighbours to be visited it’ll backtrack to its previous node (say N) and from 
this node N algorithm will start searching 
for unvisited neighbour nodes and starts visiting them.
