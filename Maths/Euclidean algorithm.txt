The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It is based on the following property:

If a and b are two positive integers with a > b, then the GCD of a and b is equal to the GCD of b and the remainder of a divided by b.
This property can be written as follows:

GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b)
This formula can be applied recursively until the remainder becomes zero, at which point the GCD is the remaining non-zero number.

Here's an example of using the Euclidean algorithm formula to find the GCD of two numbers:

Suppose we want to find the GCD of 24 and 36.

We start by applying the formula: GCD(24, 36) = GCD(36, 24 mod 36) = GCD(36, 24)
We can apply the formula again: GCD(36, 24) = GCD(24, 36 mod 24) = GCD(24, 12)
We continue: GCD(24, 12) = GCD(12, 24 mod 12) = GCD(12, 0)
Since the remainder is zero, we have found the GCD, which is the remaining non-zero number: GCD(12, 0) = 12.
Therefore, the GCD of 24 and 36 is 12
