1. Remainder :
        The Remainder is the value left after the division. If a number (dividend) is not completely 
        divisible by another number (divisor) then we are left with a value once the division is done. 
        This value is called the remainder.
        For example, 10 is not exactly divided by 3. Since the closest value, we can get 3 x 3 = 9.
        Hence, 10 ÷ 3 → 3 R 1, where 3 is the quotient and 1 is the remainder.
        1%10 : 1 : if numerator  is less than denominator then by default numbertor is remainder. so answer is 1 
        1%10 : 1 : if dividend  is less than divisor then by default numbertor is remainder. so answer is 1

2. Divide

   In division, we divide a number by any other number to get another number as a result. 
   So, the number which is getting divided here is called the dividend. 
   The number which divides a given number is the divisor. 
   And the number which we get as a result is known as the quotient. 

   Dividend / Divisor = Quotient

  : 0/1 -0
    0/10 -0 > 
    1/2: 0
    
3. Quotient: 8/40 : 5 ans

4. 8/40 :
    8 > dividend -> the number which is getting divided here is called the dividend.
    40 > divisor -> The number which divides a given number is the divisor.

Fraction : 
   A numerator is the part of a fraction above the line, which signifies the number to be divided by 
   another number below the line. In the example given below, the number that lies above the line 
   is the numerator, i.e. in the fraction 1/8, 1 represents the numerator, and 8 represents the 
   denominator.
   If the numerator is equal to 0, then the entire fraction becomes zero irrespective of the 
   denominator’s value. For example, 0⁄50 is 0, 0⁄3 is 0, and so on.

   If the numerator’s value is equal to the denominator, then the fraction’s value will be equal to 1.
   For example, 16/16 = 1, since numerator = 16 = denominator.
