Greatest common divisor
	The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers is the greatest common factor number 
	that divides them, exactly. It is also called the highest common factor (HCF). 
	For example, the greatest common factor of 15 and 10 is 5, since both the numbers can be divided 
	by 5.

	15/5 = 3

	10/5 = 2

	If a and b are two numbers then the greatest common divisor of both the numbers is denoted by 
	gcd(a, b). To find the gcd of numbers, we need to list all the factors of the numbers and find 
	the largest common factor. 

	Suppose, 4, 8 and 16 are three numbers. Then the factors of 4, 8 and 16 are:

	4 → 1,2,4

	8 → 1,2,4,8

	16 → 1,2,4,8,16

	Therefore, we can conclude that 4 is the highest common factor among all three numbers.

	How to find the greatest common divisor
	Before we move ahead on finding the greatest common factor of numbers, 
	let us understand what a factor and common factors are?

	What are Factors?
	Factors of a number divides the original number evenly. For example, if 8 is the factor of 64, 
	then 8 can divide 64 into 8 equal parts.

	What are Common Factors?
	If factor of a number is a factor of another number, then it is said to be a common factor for 
	the two numbers. For example, 2 is a factor of 4 and 8, hence 2 is a common factor.

	GCD
	GCD is the greatest common factor of two or more numbers. A factor that is the highest among 
	the numbers.

Methods to Find GCD : 
	There are several methods to find the greatest common divisor of given two numbers.

	Prime factorisation method
	Long division method
