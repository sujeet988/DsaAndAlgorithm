1. Remainder :
        The Remainder is the value left after the division. If a number (dividend) is not completely 
        divisible by another number (divisor) then we are left with a value once the division is done. 
        This value is called the remainder.
        For example, 10 is not exactly divided by 3. Since the closest value, we can get 3 x 3 = 9.
        Hence, 10 ÷ 3 → 3 R 1, where 3 is the quotient and 1 is the remainder.
        1%10 : 1 : if numerator  is less than denominator then by default numbertor is remainder. so answer is 1 
        1%10 : 1 : if dividend  is less than divisor then by default numbertor is remainder. so answer is 1

2. Divide

   In division, we divide a number by any other number to get another number as a result. 
   So, the number which is getting divided here is called the dividend. 
   The number which divides a given number is the divisor. 
   And the number which we get as a result is known as the quotient. 
   Dividend / Divisor = Quotient
  : 0/1 -0
    0/10 -0 > 
    1/2: 0
    
3. Quotient: 8/40 : 5 ans

4. 8/40 :
    8 > dividend -> the number which is getting divided here is called the dividend.
    40 > divisor -> The number which divides a given number is the divisor.
