         * Given a sorted array arr[] of n positive integers having all the numbers occurring exactly twice, except for one number which will occur only once. Find the number occurring only once.

            Examples :

            Input: n = 5, arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 5, 5}
            Output: 2
            Explanation: Since 2 occurs once, while other numbers occur twice, 2 is the answer.
            Input: n = 7, arr[] = {2, 2, 5, 5, 20, 30, 30}
            Output: 20
            Explanation: Since 20 occurs once, while other numbers occur twice, 20 is the answer.
