1.Ceil Function
-----------------
	Ceil means ceiling of our home. So, we can pick out some similarities from here. 
	That is ceil function returns an integer that is just greater than a certain rational value.

	Ceil function is used in situations where exact integer values are required which is just 
	greater than or equal to the given value.

	For example, ceil value of 3.138 is 4.

	It should be noted that this does not return the round-off value which is 3. 
	It just returns an integer that is just greater than a certain rational value.

	Example 1: Find ceil value of 5.534.

	Solution: Ceil value of 5.534 is an just greater than 5.534 i.e. 6.


	So, the ceil value of 5.534 is 6.

	Example 2: What is ceil(0.34).

	Solution: Ceil value of 0.34 is integer just greater than 0.34 i.e. 1.

	So, ceil(0.34) is 1.

	Example 3: What is ceil of 5?

	So, ceil of 5 is 5.

------------------------------------
2. Floor function

	Floor means the floor of our home. So, we can pick out some similarities from here. That is 
	floor function returns an integer that is just lesser than a certain rational value.

	Floor function is used in situations where exact integer values are required which is just 
	lesser than or equal to the given value.

	For example, ceil value of 3.883 is 3.

	It should be noted that this does not return the round-off value which is 4. It just returns 
	an integer that is just lesser than a certain rational value.

	Example 1: What is value of floor(86.43)?

    Solution: floor value of 86.43 is integer value just lesser than 86.43 that is 86.

	So, the value of floor(86.43) is 86.

	Example 2: What is floor of 67.212?

	Solution: floor of 67.212 is integer just lesser than 67.212 that is 67.

	So, floor of 67.212 is 67.

	Example 3: What is floor of 5?

	So, floor of 5 is 5.
