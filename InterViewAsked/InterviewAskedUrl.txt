You are given a string S of length N which encodes a non-negative number 
V in a binary form. Two types of operations may be performed on it to modify its 
value these operations are performed until the value of V becomes 0 . 
For example, if string S = "011100", its value V initially is 28. 
The value of V would change as follows:
- V = 28, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 14;
V = 14, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 7.
• V = 7, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 6;
V = 6, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 3; •
V = 3, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 2:
V = 2, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 1: •
V = 1, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 0.
Seven operations were required to reduce the value of V to O.
Write a function: int solution(string &S);
that, given a string S consisting of N characters containing a binary representation of the initial value V, returns the number of operations after which its value will become o. Examples
1. Given S = "011100", the function should return 7. String S represents the number 28, which becomes 0 after seven operations, as explained above.
2. Given S = "111", the function should return 5. String encodes the number V = Its value will change over the following five operations:
• V = 7, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 6;
• V = 6, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 3.
V = 3, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 2,
V = 2, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 1; •
V = 1, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 0.
3. Given S = "1111010101111', the function should return 22.
4. Given string S consisting of "1" repeated 400,000 times, the function should return 799,999.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
• string S consists only of the characters 'O' and/or '1' •
N, which is the length of string S, is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000):
the binary representation is big-endian, i.e. the first character of string corresponds to the most significant bit; •
the binary representation may contain leading zeros.
