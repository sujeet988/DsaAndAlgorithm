XOR stands for exclusive or. It ensures that either A or B is true but never both. 
In this case we're doing a bitwise operation so you can make a nice little graph of the outcomes, 
they are as follows;

0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1
0 ^ 0 = 0
Since you're applying it to integers the above outcomes are applied to each bit in the operands. 
So lets just say you have the values 1, 2, 3 for height, length, and width respectively.

You would first have

0001 ^ 0010 resulting in 0011 then that would be XOR'd into 3 so 0011 ^ 0011 which gives you 0000
