Below are some common Big-O functions while analyzing algorithms.

O(1) - Constant time
O(log(n)) - Logarithmic time
O((log(n))c) - Polylogarithmic time
O(n) - Linear time
O(n log(n)) - Linearithmic time
O(n2) - Quadratic time
O(nc) - Polynomial time
O(cn) - Exponential time
O(n!) - Factorial time
(n = size of input, c = some constant)
