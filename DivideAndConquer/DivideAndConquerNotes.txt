** The "divide and conquer" algorithm is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down 
a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining 
the solutions to solve the original problem. Here's an example of a divide and conquer algorithm 


** The divide and conquer approach typically follows these steps:
Divide and Conquer and Combine

1. Divide: The problem is divided into smaller subproblems. This can be done recursively until 
		the subproblems become simple enough to be solved directly.

2. Conquer: Each subproblem is solved independently. This step can involve applying the same 
		divide and conquer technique recursively on the subproblems.

3. Combine: The solutions of the subproblems are combined to obtain the solution to the original 
	     problem. This step is often straightforward and involves merging or aggregating the subproblem solutions.

The key idea behind divide and conquer is that solving smaller subproblems can be easier than 
solving the original problem directly. By breaking down the problem into smaller parts, the 
complexity of the problem is reduced, and it becomes more manageable. Additionally, this technique often benefits from parallelism, as the subproblems can be solved independently and concurrently.


** Example of  Divide and Conquer Approach

	Merge Sort: It divides an array into two halves, sorts them independently, and then merges the 
	sorted halves to obtain a sorted array.

	Quick Sort: It selects a pivot element, partitions the array into two subarrays based on the 
	pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

	Binary Search: It divides a sorted array into two halves and repeatedly eliminates the half in 
	which the target element cannot reside until the element is found or the array is empty.

** Divide and conquer is a powerful problem-solving technique and is widely used in various domains,
including computer science, mathematics, and algorithms. It allows for efficient solutions to complex 
problems by breaking them down into simpler, solvable components.
