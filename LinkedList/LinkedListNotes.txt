A or to B or to both, but duplicates are not allowed.

Intersection:
Given the two lists of A and B, the intersection is the largest list, which contains all the elements that are common to 
both the sets, but duplicate

list1 = 10->20->80->20->60->null
list2 = 15->20->30->60->60->45->nulls are not allowed.
Ans: given below

Union = 10->20->80->60->15->30->45->null
Intersection = 20->60->null
