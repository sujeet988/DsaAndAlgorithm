Definition of Hashing:

 it is nothing but the combination of the steps, pre-storing, and fetching.

 ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a standard character encoding 
 used in telecommunication. The ASCII pronounced ‘ask-ee’, is strictly a seven-bit code 
 based on the English alphabet.

** Tables Mapping 
Characters	Decimal	Hexadecimal
0-9			48-57	30-39
A-Z			65-90	41-5A
a-z			97-122	61-7A




 *ASCII values  for  letters
 a-z=97 to 122
 A-Z=65 to 90 

 exmaple :
 int x='a' --it will give 97 , as 97 is ascii value for a
 int x='A' = it will give 65 , as 65 is ascii value for Capital A

 --String Contains capital letters
 take the hash array size 256 chracters
