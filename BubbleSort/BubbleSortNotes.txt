Bubble Sort
------------->
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list of elements, 
compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets 
its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list while larger 
elements "sink" to the bottom, similar to bubbles rising in a liquid.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the bubble sort algorithm works:

1. Start with an unsorted list of elements.
2. Compare the first element with the second element. 
   If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of elements (second and third) and compare them. 
   Again, swap if the second element is smaller than the third element.

4. Continue this process, comparing and swapping adjacent elements until you reach the end of the 
list. This will ensure that the largest element "bubbles" to the last position in the list.
5. Now, the largest element is in its correct sorted position. Repeat the above steps for the 
remaining unsorted portion of the list, excluding the last element (which is already sorted).
6. Continue the process until the entire list is sorted.

The algorithm will keep making passes through the list until no more swaps are needed, 
indicating that the list is fully sorted. Bubble sort is not an efficient sorting algorithm, 
especially for large lists, as its average and worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), 
where "n" is the number of elements in the list. Due to this, it is generally not preferred for 
large-scale sorting tasks. However, bubble sort is easy to understand and implement, making it 
useful for educational purposes or small lists with only a few elements.
