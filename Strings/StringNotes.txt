1. Anagram 
	An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, 
	only the order of characters can be different. 
	For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are an anagram of each other.

	Note : 
	1. Both string Length  Must be same
	2. Order  of characters can be different

	Input: str1 = "listen""  str2 = "silent"
	Output: "Anagram"
	Explanation: All characters of "listen"" and "silent"" are the same and length of strings are same

	Input: str1 = "gram" str2 = "arm"
	Output: "Not Anagram beacause length is not same"

	Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
	Output: Not Anagra  > length is same but all characters is not same.

2. Substring of a string : 
	In computer programming, a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a larger string. 
	For example, in the string "hello world", the substring "world" is a part of the larger string.

	A substring is a subset or part of another string,
	or it is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.For example, "Substring" is a substring of "Substring in c#." 
	example : string str = "abc";
	Substring output : a ,b ,c ,ab,bc ,abc

3. Permutation of a string :
   In the context of computer science and mathematics, a permutation of a string is 
   a rearrangement of the characters in the string.

   Note : In general, if a string has n characters, there are n! (n factorial) possible permutations.
   exmaple : abc - herel lenght n=3 then permutation of  a string would be : 3*2*1=6
   For example, 
   1. given the string "abc", the possible permutations are:

	"abc"
	"acb"
	"bac"
	"bca"
	"cab"
	"cba"
   2. Input: str = "cd"  Output: cd dc, here length n=2 then 2! : 2*1=2 

4. Subsets of a string :
	In computer science and mathematics, a subset of a string is a collection of 
	 characters that can be obtained by selecting zero or more characters from the string, 
	 in any  order of the characters.

    For example, given the string "abc", the possible subsets are:

	{}
	{"a"}
	{"b"}
	{"c"}
	{"a", "b"}
	{"a", "c"}
	{"b", "c"}
	{"a", "b", "c"}
	In general, if a string has n characters, 
	there are 2^n possible subsets, including the empty set.
	abc =len=3 then 2*2*2=8

	Subsets are commonly used in various algorithms and data structures, 
	such as in generating all possible combinations of a set of elements 
	or in dynamic programming algorithms.

	Power set : Set of all subset ; 8 : {}
	{"a"}
	{"b"}
	{"c"}
	{"a", "b"}
	{"a", "c"}
	{"b", "c"}
	{"a", "b", "c"}

Notes : Subset vs permutation

	A subset is a collection of elements that are selected from a larger set, where the order of 
	the elements doesn't matter. For example, if you have a set of {1, 2, 3}, then some of its 
	possible subsets are {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}, and so on.

	On the other hand, a permutation is an arrangement of elements in a particular order. 
	For example, if you have a set of {1, 2, 3}, then some of its possible permutations are {1, 2, 3}, {2, 1, 3}, {3, 2, 1}, and so on.

	To summarize, the key difference between a subset and a permutation is that a subset is a 
	collection of elements where the order doesn't matter, while a permutation is an arrangement 
	of elements in a particular order
	 Examepl: in subset 1,2 or 2,1 -> bothe are same  but in permutation both are different
