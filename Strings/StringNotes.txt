1. Anagram 
	An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, 
	only the order of characters can be different. 
	For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are an anagram of each other.

	Note : 
	1. Both string Length  Must be same
	2. Order  of characters can be different

	Input: str1 = "listen""  str2 = "silent"
	Output: "Anagram"
	Explanation: All characters of "listen"" and "silent"" are the same and length of strings are same

	Input: str1 = "gram" str2 = "arm"
	Output: "Not Anagram beacause length is not same"

	Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
	Output: Not Anagra  > length is same but all characters is not same.

2. Substring of a string : 
In computer programming, a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a larger string. 
For example, in the string "hello world", the substring "world" is a part of the larger string.

A substring is a subset or part of another string,
or it is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.For example, "Substring" is a substring of "Substring in c#." 
example : string str = "abc";
Substring output : a ,b ,c ,ab,bc ,abc
