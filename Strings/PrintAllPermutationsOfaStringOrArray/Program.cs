     * A permutation also called an “arrangement number” or “order,” is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself. A string of length N has N! permutations. 
     * if array length is n=3 then permutation of that array is n!(n factorial) -> 3*2 *1=6
     * if string  length is n=4 then permutation of that array is n!(n factorial) -> 4*3*2*1=24
     * Example : Input: S = “ABC” Output: “ABC”, “ACB”, “BAC”, “BCA”, “CBA”, “CAB”
     *  * Example : Input: S = “ABC” Output: “ABC”, “ACB”, “BAC”, “BCA”, “CBA”, “CAB”
     *  Input: arr = [1, 2, 3]
